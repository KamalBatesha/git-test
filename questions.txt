-	What is the purpose of a Git repository, and how does it help front-end developers manage a project like an HTML/CSS/JS webpage?

1-tracking code changes: developers can see what was changed, when, and by whom.
2-restoring previous versions
3-multiple developers can work on the same project 

-	Explain the difference between tracked and untracked files in Git, and why might untracked files cause issues in a front-end project?

untracked files are files that exist in the project directory but haven’t been staged or committed to Git yet
tracked files are files that exist in the project directory and have been staged or committed to Git 

-	Why is it important to use a file to ignore certain items (e.g., node_modules) in a Git repository, especially for front-end development?

to ignore files like:
node_modules/ contains thousands of files from third-party libraries installed via npm
.env/Ignoring unnecessary or sensitive files keeps the repository clean and secure

-	How does viewing a project’s history benefit a front-end developer when working on multiple versions of a webpage?

understand the evolution of the project and why certain changes were made.
collaborate better, as developers

-	What is the role of GitHub in relation to a local Git repository, and how does hosting a project on GitHub Pages add value for a front-end developer

gitHub is a remote hosting service for Git repositories. It allows developers to:
store their code online.
collaborate through pull requests and issues.
back up their project and access it from anywhere.
